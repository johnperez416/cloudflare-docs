During an [internal DNS query resolution](/dns/internal-dns/#architecture-overview), if no internal record is found within a matching internal zone, Cloudflare will check if the matching internal zone is referencing another internal zone. Successive references can be followed with a maximum of five references in a chain.

Each internal zone can only reference one other zone, but the same zone can be referenced by multiple internal zones. Public zones cannot be used as reference zones.

## Steps

To set up a reference zone, use the [Update DNS settings](/api/resources/dns/subresources/settings/methods/edit/) endpoint. In `--data`, specify the `internal_dns` object with the parameter `reference_zone_id`.

<Example>
<Render file="internal-reference-zone-api"/>

A third zone (C) could also point to zone B as a reference, but zone A cannot add another zone as a reference while also having zone B configured as its reference zone.
