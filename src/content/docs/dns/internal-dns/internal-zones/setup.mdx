Refer to the following sections to learn how to manage your internal DNS zones.

## Configuration conditions

When setting up internal zones, observe the following conditions:

<Render file="internal-zones-conditions" />

## Create an internal zone

1. Use the [Create Zone](/api/resources/zones/) endpoint to create an internal zone. Specify your account ID and set the `type` to `internal`.
2. Add DNS records to your internal zone using your preferred option:
- [Import](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/import/) a formatted BIND file. Refer to the [DNS records how-to](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/import-and-export/) for guidance.
- Use other API endpoints, such as [`/batch`](/api/resources/dns/subresources/records/methods/batch/), to manage DNS records. Refer to [Batch record changes](/dns/manage-dns-records/how-to/batch-record-changes/#use-the-api) for details.
3. Repeat this process for each internal zone you wish to add.

Since the resolver policy configuration will require a DNS view, you must link the internal zones to at least one view to be able to use them when routing requests to Internal DNS. For a full procedure overview, refer to [get started](/dns/internal-dns/get-started/).


## Other actions

The API endpoints to manage internal zones are the same as for managing public zones. The main difference is that the zone type must be set to `internal`. Refer to the API documentation below for details:

- [Update an internal zone](/api/resources/zones/methods/edit/) (`PATCH`)
- [Get internal zone details](/api/resources/zones/methods/get/) (`GET`)
- [List internal zones](/api/resources/zones/methods/list/) (`GET`)
- [Delete an internal zone](/api/resources/zones/methods/delete/) (`DELETE`)
