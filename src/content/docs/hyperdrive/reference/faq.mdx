Below you will find answers to our most commonly asked questions regarding Hyperdrive.

## Connectivity

### Does Hyperdrive use specific IP addresses to connect to my database?

Hyperdrive connects to your database using [Cloudflare's IP address ranges](https://www.cloudflare.com/ips/). These are shared by all Hyperdrive configurations and other Cloudflare products.

You can use this to configure restrictions in your database firewall to restrict the IP addresses that can access your database.

## Pricing

### Does Hyperdrive charge for data transfer / egress?

No.

### Is Hyperdrive available on the [Workers Free](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers) plan?

Not at this time.

### Does Hyperdrive charge for additional compute?

Hyperdrive itself does not charge for compute (CPU) or processing (wall clock) time. Workers querying Hyperdrive and computing results: for example, serializing results into JSON and/or issuing queries, are billed per [Workers pricing](/workers/platform/pricing/#workers).

## Limits

### Are there any limits to Hyperdrive?

Refer to the published [limits](/hyperdrive/platform/limits/) documentation.
