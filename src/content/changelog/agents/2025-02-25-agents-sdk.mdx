We've released the [agents-sdk](http://blog.cloudflare.com/build-ai-agents-on-cloudflare/), a package and set of tools that help you build and ship AI Agents.

You can get up and running with a [chat-based AI Agent](https://github.com/cloudflare/agents-starter) (and deploy it to Workers) that uses the `agents-sdk`, tool calling, and state syncing with a React-based front-end by running the following command:

```sh
npm create cloudflare@latest agents-starter -- --template="cloudflare/agents-starter"
# open up README.md and follow the instructions
```

You can also add an Agent to any existing Workers application by installing the `agents-sdk` package directly

```sh
npm i agents-sdk
```

... and then define your first Agent:

```ts
import { Agent } from 'agents-sdk';

export class YourAgent extends Agent<Env> {
	// Build it out
	// Access state on this.state or query the Agent's database via this.sql
	// Handle WebSocket events with onConnect and onMessage
	// Run tasks on a schedule with this.schedule
	// Call AI models
	// ... and/or call other Agents.
}
```

Head over to the [Agents documentation](/agents/) to learn more about the `agents-sdk`, the SDK APIs, as well as how to test and deploying agents to production.
